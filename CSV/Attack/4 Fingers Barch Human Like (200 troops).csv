      |100 troops = 25 per side = 12.5 (13) per slice
      |drop points = 28 per side, 14 per slice
      |drops from 2-27 on each side (leaving room for fingers to make realistic)
      |adds 10 tiles from red line to drop at edge of diamond

      |Note2: This attack will only drop barbarians and archers (and selected heroes and castle).

      |and barbs that will be dropped in each attack.
