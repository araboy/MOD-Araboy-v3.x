      |120 troops = 30 per side = 15 per slice
      |drop points = 34 per side, 17 per slice
      |drops from 3-32 on each side (leaving room for fingers to make realistic)
      |adds 10 tiles from red line to drop at edge of diamond

      |Troop order: Giant,Barb,Wall,Arch,Gobl,Castle,Hogs,Wiza,Mini,Gobl,King,Queen,Warden
      |Also drops remaining troops: Ball, Heal, Drag, Pekk, Valk, Gole, Witc, Lava 
      |(if they are not deployed, then they won't be dropped, and take up space for other troops)

      |Note2: This attack works best with the AwesomeGamer Mod Bot. It has 3 enhancements and a bug fix:
      |1. The troop drop speed has been optimized and increased.
      |2. The USE RED LINE=NO option has been added to the SIDE command.  This allows the troops to be
      |dropped evenly from the edge ignoring the red line.
      |3. Added the ability to have more than 4 vectors in a DROP command.  See my 8F Barch attack (8 fingers).
      |4. Fixed issue with all heroes being dropped together and boosting immediately.
